    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is changing the working world, affecting jobs and livelihood. This makes AI an important topic to study. Jobs that are related to AI, such as data science, robotics, and machine learning, are becoming more common, often paying well. Simultaneously, traditional jobs such as farming, retail, or office work are slowly being reduced and taken over due to automation and new advanced technology taking over. This does not imply that every job disappears; however, it does mean that the job market is shifting alongside AI, and people are starting to worry that their future careers might not be as secure as before.\nIn 2024, people are worried about job security as many industries are already adopting AI tools. Some see AI as a threat to their jobs, while others see it as a chance to move into new roles. Looking at AI versus non-AI careers will help us further understand how and where job opportunities are growing, which areas are shrinking, and what skills people may need to adapt in the future.\n\n\nResearch Rationale\nThis topic is not only important, but also interesting to understand because it highlights how the progress of AI can actually eliminate and create jobs at the same time. In 2024, many companies are integrating AI, accelerating changes in the job market. Automation is replacing repetitive tasks, while AI-driven roles are much higher in demand. However, this transition is not equal.\nAI affects people differently depending on their job, skill level, and where they live. For example, store cashiers are being replaced by self-checkout machines, but new jobs like AI engineers are being created to build and maintain those systems. The problem is that it might take five people to run a store, but an entire company may only need a few engineers to build the technology that replaces these cashiers. This means that some workers may lose jobs unless they learn new skills (see e.g., Tiwari ((2023))).\n\n\nPreliminary Discussion\nAI has already shown a large positive impact: it reduces the need for workers in routine tasks while simultaneously creating new job roles like AI ethics officers and prompt engineers. These jobs did not exist a decade ago, which shows that AI is not necessarily taking away jobs but also opening new career paths.\nThe real issue is that the shift is uneven. It is not always a fair trade when losing one job and gaining another because some countries with strong economies may be able to support workers with training programs, but poorer countries may not. It should also be noted that there will be workers who are not interested in technological roles. This shows that AI’s impact depends on economics, training opportunities, and even personal preference and interest. In some settings AI tools raise worker productivity—especially for newer workers—rather than replace them outright (Brynjolfsson, Li, and Raymond ((2023))); employers are also placing more value on complementary human skills (teamwork, adaptability, digital literacy) even as purely routine tasks decline (Mäkelä and Stephany ((2024))).\n\n\nLiterature Review\nResearchers have studied how AI is affecting jobs, and findings vary. Tiwari ((2023)) explains that while AI/ML can replace some roles—especially repetitive, routine work—they also create opportunities in areas like data analysis and AI system development. The key challenge is reskilling: workers’ ability to adapt to new roles determines whether they benefit.\nOther studies show that AI can help workers instead of only replacing them. Brynjolfsson, Li, and Raymond ((2023)) find that customer service workers, especially new ones, became more productive when using AI tools alongside normal tasks. Mäkelä and Stephany ((2024)) analyze job ads across countries and find demand rising for human, complementary skills (teamwork, adaptability, digital literacy), while demand falls for narrowly routine tasks. Together, these findings suggest AI’s effects are heterogeneous: outcomes vary by occupation, tasks, skills, and context.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBrynjolfsson, E., D. Li, and L. Raymond.

With a career in data analysis and visualization, Machine Learning isn’t her top priority, but Cloud Computing is worth developing further. Strengthening Python would also be valuable, as it’s essential for data analysts. A good approach is to sharpen her skills through small personal projects and apply what she learns at work. If her fundamentals feel solid, she can move towards certifications.\nWei: Her Python and Machine Learning are at a basic level, so she has the option to develop them further depending on how relevant they are to her career path. Since her SQL is already stronger, focusing on Python would be the most practical next step if she chooses to continue building technical skills. A good approach is to take it gradually through small projects and applied practice, and then expand into more advanced areas only if it fits her goals.\nConnor: His skills are fairly even across all areas, at a basic stage, which gives him room to build depth. Bumping Python up to a stronger level would give him the most flexibility, while also continuing to grow in Cloud Computing to keep pace with current tools and workflows. A steady way forward is to practice Python through hands-on work and then bring in cloud tools as he becomes more confident."
