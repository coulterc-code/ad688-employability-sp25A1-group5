### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

```{python}
Job Postings by Industry (Top 15)
import plotly.express as px

counts = (
    df["INDUSTRY_DISPLAY"]
    .value_counts(dropna=False)
    .head(15)
    .reset_index(name="Count")
    .rename(columns={"index": "Industry"})
    .sort_values("Count")
)
fig1 = px.bar(
    counts, x="Count", y="Industry", orientation="h",
    title="Top 15 Industries by Number of Job Postings"
)
fig1.show()

Salary Distribution by Industry (Top 15)
sdf = df[["INDUSTRY_DISPLAY","SALARY_DISPLAY"]].copy()
sdf = sdf.dropna()
sdf = sdf[sdf["SALARY_DISPLAY"] > 0]

top_industries = sdf["INDUSTRY_DISPLAY"].value_counts().head(15).index
sdf = sdf[sdf["INDUSTRY_DISPLAY"].isin(top_industries)]

fig2 = px.box(
    sdf, x="INDUSTRY_DISPLAY", y="SALARY_DISPLAY",
    title="Salary Distribution by Industry (Top 15)",
    points=False
)
fig2.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=-45)
fig2.show()

Remote vs. On-Site Jobs
if "REMOTE_TYPE_NAME" in df.columns:
    rc = df["REMOTE_TYPE_NAME"].value_counts().reset_index()
    rc.columns = ["Remote Type","Count"]
    fig3 = px.pie(
        rc, names="Remote Type", values="Count",
        title="Remote vs. On-Site Job Distribution"
    )
    fig3.show()
