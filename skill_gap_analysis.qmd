# 3.1.3 Improvement Plan
Balqis: Her Machine Learning and Cloud Computing are at a basic level, so there’s room to grow. Since her career path is in data analysis with a focus on visualization, Machine Learning isn’t her top priority, but Cloud Computing is worth developing further. She should also raise her Python to an advanced level, as it’s essential for data analysts. A good approach is to start with small personal projects, apply what she learns at work, and then pursue certifications once she’s confident with the basics.
